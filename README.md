# Definite Integral
Calculates the definite integral of a given function over a given range using a Riemann sum. The user defines the number of partitions to be made for the Riemann sum (more partitions means a more accurate answer, but also increase the compute time). The user is also able to define whether LRAM, MRAM, or RRAM is used.

NOTE: There are floating point errors.
